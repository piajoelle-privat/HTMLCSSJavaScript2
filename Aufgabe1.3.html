    <h2>Tesla Model 2</h2>
    <p> <span style="font-size:10;">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia </span>
    </p>
    <p>The Tesla Model S is a <b><i>full-sized all-electric five-door, luxury liftback car</i> </b>, produced by Tesla
        Motors, and introduced in June 2012.[10] It scored a perfect 5.0 NHTSA automobile safety rating.
        The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) official range for the 2012 Model S
        Performance model equipped with an 85 kWh battery pack is 265 miles (426 km), higher than any
        other electric car at the time.[11][12][13] EPA rates its energy consumption at 237.5 Wh per kilometer
        (38 kWh/100 mi) for a combined fuel economy of 89 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (2.64 L/100
        km or 107 mpg-imp).[11][14]</p>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>The Model S was styled by Franz von Holzhausen, who previously worked for Mazda North
            American Operations.[26] The car was codenamed WhiteStar during research and preliminary
            development.[1][2][3]</p>
    <hr>
    <p>In February 2008 it was reported that Tesla Motors was planning to offer a range-extended version of
        its Model S. This version would have included a gasoline engine to extend the driving range of the
        vehicle,[30] but it was removed in later revisions. At the GoingGreen conference in September 2008
        Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, announced that Tesla was developing only electric cars.[31]</p>
